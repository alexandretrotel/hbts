To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts

But you should rather install it globally and setup your own Neon database:

```bash
bun add -g hbts
habits setup
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.11. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
